# Student Registration System

The **Student Registration System** is a desktop-based application developed using Python and Tkinter. 
This project aims to simplify the process of registering students and storing their details efficiently in an Excel file. 
While the application is currently under development, it already includes features for capturing and managing student and parent details.

## Features (Implemented So Far)

- **Student Information Management**:
  - Input fields for capturing student details like Name, Class, Gender, Date of Birth, Religion, and Skills.
  - Parent information fields for Father's and Mother's names and occupations.
- **Excel Integration**:
  - Student details are stored in an Excel file (`Student_data.xlsx`).
  - If the file does not exist, it is automatically created during the application's first run.
- **Image Upload**:
  - Allows users to upload a studentâ€™s image.
- **Basic Functionality**:
  - Reset functionality to clear the form.
  - Save functionality to store data into the Excel file.
  - Exit button to close the application.

## Features Under Development

- **Search and Update**:
  - Implementing a search bar to find and update student records.
- **Error Handling**:
